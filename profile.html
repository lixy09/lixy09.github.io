                    <p>I'm curious about new things and has enthusiasm to learn them. I'm also an optimist. I always believe that nothing is difficult and everything will be fine. So I have confidence in myself.</p>

                    <legend>Weaknesses</legend>
                    <p>My immediate resonse to conversation is a little bit slow. For example, if there's a team project discussion, it would take me some time to think about other people's words and then give the reaction. But if it's an online-typing discussion, I'll be fine. </p>

                    <p>I know that in the IT industry, technology is keep updating frequently, like a new language or frame. I'm ready to keep up with the pace.</p>

                <fieldset>
                    <legend>Threats</legend>
                    <p>The biggest threat for me is time planning. As a student, there would be lots of courseworks, quizzes and exams. So if I still want some leisure time, I really need to organize my time well.</p>
