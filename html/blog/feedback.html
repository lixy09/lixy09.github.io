                <p>Reading your motivation, I am glad to see you acknowledge the importance and usefulness of technology in your daily lives but I encourage you to search for a stronger motivation that will keep pushing you forward in this 4 year study. Think of what you wish to accomplish with these studies that maybe you cannot do by studying coding on your own at home. Maybe check more about this program and see what you like in it and why.</p>
                <p>To help you get a better idea of your options and possibilities after completing your studies I recommend you to do a bit more research on the different kinds of jobs and roles you could be working at in the future, maybe check out some companies and their descriptions of different positions. Also I highly recommend you to come to the IT conference next year, there real companies will attend and you can talk with them about the opportunities and get a better idea of the IT department.</p>
                <p>Looking at your SWOT analysis, its clear that you did check within yourself and acknowledged some of your strengths and weaknesses. To help you in your first year I recommend you to check for ideas or tools that may help you with your challenges such as planning, maybe check out some planning tools, or start creating a habit of scheduling / writing tasks for yourself, very important to also include breaks and fun time too! Maybe check what may help you in team discussions to feel more comfortable or to react better. I encourage your optimistic view and I am sure it will come in very handy during the studies.</p>
